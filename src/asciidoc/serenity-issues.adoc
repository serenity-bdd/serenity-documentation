Serenity BDD allows create links between stories/tests and issues. Sometimes it is useful for complex development workflow, and for organizing self-documented tests.

Configuration of links is made by annotations and property `serenity.issue.tracker.url` that can be provided in serenity.params or using system variables. The URL provided by `serenity.issue.tracker.url` is used as "body of link", and issue name provided in annotations - last part of this link.

Generally in annotations you should use name of issues according to mask #(NAME)(-)(NUMBER), link will be created to (NAME)(-)(NUMBER), below you can find example.

==== Linking with issues for JUnit
When tests created with JUnit you can use annotations `@Issue`, `@Issues`, `@Title`.

* `@Issue` used for linking single issue. It should be initialised with name of referenced issue, started with `#`
* `@Issues` used for linking multiple issues. It should be initialised with array with names of referenced issues, started with `#`
* `@Title` used for providing readable name of test case (more in <<Human-readable method titles>>), also it can be used to linking multiple issues to this scenario - in title should be included name of issue started with `#`

Here is little example with test cases linked to issues:

serenity.properties contains:

[source,gherkin]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-tests-linked-to-issues/serenity.properties[]
----


test class looks like:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-tests-linked-to-issues/src/test/java/net/serenity/samples/retries/SampleTest.java[]
----

In this case report will look like:

[[jbehave-requirements-report]]
.Report with test cases linked to issues
image::tests_with_references_to_issues.png[]

Also, all references clickable and will be :
----
#PN-97:  https://example.server.com/cases/view/PN-97
#KB-927: https://example.server.com/cases/view/KB-927
#NO-97:  https://example.server.com/cases/view/NO-97
----

==== Linking with issues for JBehave
Also you can use the `@issue` annotation or `#` in scenario name to link scenarios with issues when using JBehave, as illustrated here:

[source,gherkin]
----
Meta:
@issue #MYPROJ-1, #MYPROJ-2

Scenario: A scenario that works according #MP-4
Meta:
@issues #MYPROJ-3,#MYPROJ-4
@issue #MYPROJ-5

Given I have an implemented JBehave scenario
And the scenario works
When I run the scenario
Then I should get a successful result
----

In this case links will be created according same rules as for <<Linking with issues for JUnit>>


==== Linking with issues for Cucumber
The `@issue` or `@issues` annotations can be used in Cucumber `.feature` files to link scenarios with issues , as shown below:

[source,gherkin]
----

@issues:ISSUE-123,ISSUE-789
Feature: Basic Arithmetic
  Calculating Additions

  Background: A Calculator
    Given a calculator I just turned on

  @issues:ISSUE-456,ISSUE-001
  Scenario: Addition
    When I add 4 and 5
    Then the result is 9

  @issue:ISSUE-456
  Scenario: Another Addition
    When I add 4 and 7
    Then the result is 11

Serenity BDD integrates with http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] via the `serenity-maven-plugin`. 
An example of a `pom.xml` file using Serenity BDD is shown here:

[source,xml]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-quick-start/pom.xml[]
----
<1> Core Serenity dependency
<2> JUnit Serenity dependency
<3> The Maven Failsafe plugin
<4> Include only tests in the `junit` directory
<5> The Serenity Maven Plugin
<6> Generate the aggregate reports during the post-integration test phase
<7> Call the 'aggregate' goal to generate them
<8> Pass the `webdriver.driver` system property to the tests.

First, you need to add the Serenity BDD dependencies to your project. You will typically add `core` and another dependency that correpsonds to the testing library you are using (JUnit in this example).Pt.1 and Pt.2 ( ?? can user is allowed to use any other unit testing tool like testNG etc )

You typically want the Serenity tests to run as integration tests rather than as unit tests (?? isn't it should be regression integration cases ). You also want the build not to immediately fail when a test fails, but to continue until it has generated the Serenity aggregate reports before failing at the end of the build. To do this, we use the `maven-failsafe-plugin`. Pt.3

Normal JUnit tests run from Maven need to start or end with `Test`. But for acceptance tests, a more flexible strategy is better, as it makes it easier to name test cases after scenarios or stories. In the `pom.xml` file shown above, we configure the `maven-failsafe-plugin` to run all of the tests in the `junit` directory, regardless of how they are named. Pt. 4

Next, you need to add and configure the `serenity-maven-plugin`.Pt. 5 A useful technique is to bind the `aggregate` goal plugin to the `post-integration-test` phase. Pt.6 and Pt.7 This way, to run the tests and to generate the reports, you would run the following:

[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----

This will run the tests and generate an aggregate report in the `target/site/thucydides` directory.

Like the surefire plugin the `maven-failsafe-plugin` starts a new JVM instance to run the tests. For this reason, if you need to pass system parameters to the tests (for example, the `webdriver.driver` property shown here), you need to use the `<systemProperties>` section

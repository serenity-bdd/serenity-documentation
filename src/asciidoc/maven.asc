Serenity integrates with Maven via the `serenity-maven-plugin`. A full example of a `pom.xml` file using Serenity is shown here:

[source,xml]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-quick-start/pom.xml[]
----
<1> Core Serenity dependency
<2> JUnit Serenity dependency
<3> The Maven Failsafe plugin
<4> Include only tests in the `junit` directory
<5> The Serenity Maven Plugin
<6> Generate the aggregate reports during the post-integration test phase
<7> Call the 'aggregate' goal to generate them
<8> Pass the `webdriver.driver` system property to the tests.

First, you need to add the Serenity dependencies to your project. You will typically add `core` and another dependency that correpsonds to the testing library you are using (JUnit in this example).

You typically want the Serenity tests to run s integration tests rather then as unit tests. You also want the build not to immediately fail when a test fails, but to continue until it has generated the Serenity aggregate reports before failing at the end of the build. To do this, we use the `maven-failsafe-plugin`. 

Normal JUnit tests run from Maven need to start or end with `Test`. But for acceptance tests, a more flexible strategy is better, as it makes it easier to name test cases after scenarios or stories. In the `pom.xml` file shown above, we configure the `maven-failsafe-plugin` to run all of the tests in the `junit` directory, regardless of how they are named.

Next, you need to add and configure the `serenity-maven-plugin`. A useful technique is to bind the `aggregate` goal plugin to the `post-integration-test` phase. This way, to run the tests and to generate the reports, you would run the following:

[source,bash]
----
mvn verify
----

This will run the tests and generate an aggregate report in the `target/site/thucydides` directory.

Like the surefire plugin the `maven-failsafe-plugin` starts a new JVM instance to run the tests. For this reason, if you need to pass system parameters to the tests (for example, the `webdriver.driver` property shown here), you need to use the `<systemProperties>` section

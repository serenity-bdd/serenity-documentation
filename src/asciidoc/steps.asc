In Serenity, tests are broken down into reusable steps. An important principle behind Serenity is the idea that it is easier to maintain a test that uses several layers of abstraction to hide the complexity behind different parts of a test. For example, the first test in the following sample is broken into three steps:

  . Create a new Frequent Flyer member
  . Check that the member has a status of Bronze

The second is also broken into steps:

  . Create a new Frequent Flyer member
  . Make the member fly 10000 km
  . Check that the member has a status of Silver

----

Notice how the second test reuses step methods used in the first to perform a slightly different test. This is a typical example of the way we reuse steps in similar tests, in order to avoid duplicated code and make the code easier to maintain.

Also notice how we did not need to instantiate the Step class. When you annotated a member variable with the `@Steps` annotation, Serenity will automatically instantiate it for you.

Step methods are annotated with the `@Step` annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-quick-start/src/test/java/net/serenitybdd/samples/junit/steps/TravellerStatusSteps.java[tags=testcase]
----
<1> Step classes can extend any class, or none
<2> The `@Step` annotation denotes a Serenity step method
<3> The `@Step` can take a String value to override the default step name

By default, the name of a step is derived from the method name. If you want something more readable, you can add a String parameter to the `@Step` annotation. If you put references to variables in the string (`{0}`, `{1}` etc.), Serenity will inject the method parameters into the string. So suppose you define a `@Step` method like this:
[source,java]
----
@Step("The traveller should have {0} status") 
public void traveller_should_have_a_status_of(Status expectedStatus) { 
    ...
}
----
When you call this method with a given parameter:
[source,java]
----
travellerSteps.traveller_should_have_a_status_of(Bronze);
----
Then the step title will be the following:
----
"The traveller should have Bronze status"
----

Serenity step methods also play an important role in the reporting. When the reports are generated, methods annotated with the `@Step` annotation will appear as lines in the report.

=== Storing data between steps

Sometimes it is useful to be able to pass information between steps. For example, you might need to check that client detailed entered on a registration appears correctly on a confirmation page later on.

You can do this by setting member variables in the step definition classes. In the following code, the `frequentFlyer` member variable is set in the first `@Step` method, and then reused in the subsequent steps.

[source,java]

----

A third approach is to use the Serenity test session, which is essentially a hash map where you can store variables for the duration of a single test. Variables in the Serenity test session are available in any step definition class.

The following example shows a simple web test:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-quick-start/src/test/java/net/serenitybdd/samples/junit/features/searching/WhenSearchingFlights.java[tags=testcase]
----

We need to store the destination city in the first step to be used in the last step. We could do this using the Serenity session as shown here:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-quick-start/src/test/java/net/serenitybdd/samples/junit/steps/FlightSearchSteps.java[tags=classbody]
----
<1> Store the departure city in a session variable
<2> Retrieve the session variable in another step

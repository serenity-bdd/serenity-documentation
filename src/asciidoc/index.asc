== Introducing Serenity

image::serenity-logo.png[]

Serenity BDD is an open source library that aims to make the idea of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example[living documentation] a reality.

Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.  

One key advantage of using Serenity BDD is that you do not have to invest time in building and maintaining your own automation framework.

Serenity BDD provides strong support for automated web tests using http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver[Selenium 2], though it also works very effectively for non-web tests such as tests that exercise web services or even call application code directly.
          
The aim of Serenity is to make it easy to quickly write well-structured, maintainable automated acceptance criteria, using your favorite BDD or conventional testing library. You can work with Behavior-Driven-Development tools like Cucumber or JBehave, or simply use JUnit. You can integrate with requirements stored in an external source (such as JIRA or any other test cases mangement tool), or just use a simple directory-based approach to organize your requirements.

Up until November 2014, Serenity went by the name of Thucydides.

== Different Ways of Building your Project
 
Serenity tries to fit into your current build practices, whether you are using Maven, Gradle or even Ant. We assume you have some background in Java build tools, but if you are curious http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-build-tools-maven-gradle-and-ant-plus-the-dsl-vs-xml-debate/[here is a rundown of all three].

=== Custom WebDriver implementations

You can add your own custom WebDriver provider by implementing the DriverSource interface. First, you need to set up the following system properties (e.g. in your `serenity.properties` file):

---
webdriver.driver = provided
webdriver.provided.type = mydriver
webdriver.provided.mydriver = com.acme.MyPhantomJSDriver
thucydides.driver.capabilities = mydriver
---

Your custom driver must implement the DriverSource interface, as shown here:

---
public class MyPhantomJSDriver implements DriverSource {

    @Override
    public WebDriver newDriver() {
        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.phantomjs();
            // Add
            return new PhantomJSDriver(ResolvingPhantomJSDriverService.createDefaultService(), capabilities);
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            throw new Error(e);
        }
    }

	@Override
    public boolean takesScreenshots() {
        return true;
    }
}
---

This driver will now take screenshots normally.

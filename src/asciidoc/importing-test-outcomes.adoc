During execution of test Serenity BDD generate Test Outcomes and use them to build aggregated report. It is possible for some external tools load test outcomes and analise them.

=== Loading Test OutComes from folder

Test outcomes by default are generated in XML and JSON format, both format contains same information - testcase, suites, test results, rest queries and so on.
Serenity BDD uses recreation of these test result - 'TestOutcome' and some extra features available in 'TestOutcomes'.

To load test outcome you should know their format and folder:

[source,java]
----
....
OutcomeFormat format = OutcomeFormat.XML;
TestOutcomes outcomes = TestOutcomeLoader.loadTestOutcomes().inFormat(format)
....
----

=== Analysing Test OutComes

It is easy to analise test outcomes, for example for getting all passed test you should:

[source,java]
----
....
outcomes.getPassingTests();
....
----

Also you can get a lot of information from test ourcomes about execute tests, for example:

[source,java]
----
....
 for (final TestOutcome outcome : outcomes.getOutcomes()) {
     System.out.println(outcome.getCompleteName());
     System.out.println(outcome.getTestCaseName());
     System.out.println(outcome.getResult());
     System.out.println(outcome.getDurationInSeconds());
     System.out.println(outcome.getDataTable()); // if test was with some data table
     System.out.println(outcome.getIssueKeys());
 }
....

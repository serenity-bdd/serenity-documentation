One of the key goals of the Serenity reports is to turn test reports into _living documentation_. One of the ways it does this for web tests is to record screenshots at key steps throughout the execution of a test.

However, recording a large number of screenshots can slow down test execution. For this reason, Serenity lets you configure how often you record screenshots during test execution. For example, you may want to record screenshots only for test failures during a local test run, but record all of the screenshots during a nightly build. Serenity provides many options to help you determine exactly how many screenshots will be recorded.

=== Basic screenshot configuration

The simplest screenshot configuration option is the +serenity.take.screenshots+ property. This property can take the following values:

+FOR_EACH_ACTION+:: Saves a screenshot at every web element action (like click(), typeAndEnter(), type(), typeAndTab() etc.).

+BEFORE_AND_AFTER_EACH_STEP+:: Saves a screenshot before and after every step.

+AFTER_EACH_STEP+:: Saves a screenshot after every step

+FOR_FAILURES+:: Saves screenshots only for failing steps.

+DISABLED+:: Doesn't save screenshots for any steps.

=== Using annotations to control screenshots
An even more granular level of control is possible using annotations. You can annotate any test or step method (or any method used by a step or test) with the +@Screenshots+ annotation to override the number of screenshots taken within this step (or sub-step). Some sample uses are shown here:

[source,java]
------------------
@Step
@Screenshots(onlyOnFailures=true)
public void screenshots_will_only_be_taken_for_failures_from_here_on() {…}

@Test
@Screenshots(forEachStep=true)
public void should_take_screenshots_for_each_step_in_this_test() {…}

@Test
@Screenshots(forEachAction=true)
public void should_take_screenshots_for_each_action_in_this_test() {…}

@Test
@Screenshots(disabled=true)
public void should_not_take_screenshots_for_any_action_in_this_test(() {…}
------------------

=== Class-specific screenshot configuration with ScreenPlay

If you are using http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_serenity_and_the_screenplay_pattern[Screenplay],
you can configure which tasks and actions should have screenshots. In Screenplay, a `Task` represents something a user needs to do to achieve some goal, expressed in business, not technical, terms. For example, "Add an item to the todo list". An `Interaction` represents how the user interacts with the application to perform a task, for example "enter 'buy some milk' into the input field", or "click on the 'add' button".

The following class represents the business task of adding an item to a todo list.

[source,java]
----
public class AddATodoItem implements Task {                         <1>

    private final String thingToDo;

    @Step("{0} adds a todo item called: #thingToDo")
    public <T extends Actor> void performAs(T theActor) {
        theActor.attemptsTo(
            Enter.theValue(thingToDo)                               <2>
                .into(WHAT_NEEDS_TO_BE_DONE)
                .thenHit(RETURN)
        );
    }

    public static AddATodoItem called(String thingToDo) {
        return instrumented(AddATodoItem.class, thingToDo);
    }
    public AddATodoItem(String thingToDo) { this.thingToDo = thingToDo; }
}
----
<1> A `Task` represents a business Task
<2> To perform a task, the user interacts with the application using `Action`s

Serenity lets you fine-tune when screenshots should be taken using a simple DSL based on the `serenity.take.screenshot.for.*` properties. If you wanted to take screenshots before and after each `Task`, but only for failing `Interaction`s, you could write something like this:

----
serenity.take.screenshot.for.interactions = FOR_FAILURES
serenity.take.screenshot.for.tasks = BEFORE_AND_AFTER_EACH_STEP
----

You can also configure screenshots for your own classes or interfaces. For example, imagine you had written your own `Refresh` interaction as shown here:

[source,java]
----
import static net.serenitybdd.screenplay.abilities.BrowseTheWeb.as;

public class Refresh implements Interaction {
    @Override
    public <T extends Actor> void performAs(T actor) {
        as(actor).getDriver().navigate().refresh();
    }

    public static Refresh theBrowserSession() {
        return new Refresh();
    }
}
----

If you don't want any screenshots to be taken for this particular interaction, you could add the following property:

----
serenity.take.screenshot.for.refresh = DISABLED
----

Or you might prefer a more general solution, and define an interface for all of the tasks or actions that you want to configure:

[source,java]
----
public interface NoScreenshots {}
----

Now you can configure screenshots for any Task or Interaction that implements this interface with a single line:

----
serenity.take.screenshot.for.noscreenshots = DISABLED
----

=== Taking screenshots at any arbitrary point during a step
It is possible to have even finer control on capturing screenshots in the tests. Using the +takeScreenshot+ method, you can  instruct Serenity to take a screenshot at any arbitrary point in the step irrespective of the screenshot level set using configuration or annotations.

Simply call +Serenity.takeScreenshot()+ in the step methods whenever you want a screenshot to be captured.


=== Increasing the size of screenshots
Sometimes the default window size is too small to display all of the application screen in the screenshots. You can increase the size of the window Serenity opens by providing the +Serenity.browser.width+ and +Serenity.browser.height+ system properties. Typically, the width parameter is the only one you will need to specify, as the height will be determined by the contents of the browser page.

You can also set the `serenity.browser.maximize` property to `true` to get WebDriver to maximize the browser at the start of the tests.

When the browser width is larger than 1000px, the slideshow view in the reports will expand to show the full screenshots.

Note there are some caveats with this feature. In particular, it will not work at all with Chrome, as Chrome, by design, does not support window resizing. In addition, since WebDriver uses a real browser, so the maximum size will be limited by the physical size of the browser. This limitation applies to the browser width, as the full vertical length of the screen will still be recorded in the screenshot even if it scrolls beyond a single page.

==== Screenshots and OutOfMemoryError issues
Selenium needs memory to take screenshots, particularly if the screens are large. If Selenium runs out of memory when taking screenshots, it will log an error in the test output. In this case, configure the maven-surefire-plugin to use more memory, as illustrated here:

[source,xml]
------------------
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <argLine>-Xmx1024m</argLine>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
------------------

=== Saving raw screenshots
Serenity saves only rescaled screenshots by default. This is done to help reduce the disk space taken by reports. If you require to save the original unscaled screenshots, this default can be easily overridden by setting the property, +serenity.keep.unscaled.screenshots+ to +true+.

=== Blurring sensitive screenshots
For security/privacy reasons, it may be required to blur sensitive screenshots in Serenity reports. This can be done by annotating the test methods or steps with the annotation +@BlurScreenshots+. When defined on a test, all screenshots for that test will be blurred. When defined on a step, only the screenshot for that step will be blurred. @BlurredScreenshot takes a string parameter with values +LIGHT, MEDIUM+ or +HEAVY+ to indicate the amount of blurring. For example,

[source,java]
------------------
@Test
@BlurScreenshots("HEAVY")
public void looking_up_the_definition_of_pineapple_should_display_the_corresponding_article() {
    endUser.is_the_home_page();
    endUser.looks_for("pineapple");
    endUser.should_see_definition_containing_words("A thorny fruit");
}
------------------

A screen at various blur levels is shown below.

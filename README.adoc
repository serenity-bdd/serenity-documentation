= Serenity BDD Documentation

This project contains the main Serenity BDD documentation.
The documentation is broken up into chapters, so many people can contribute simultaneously.

== Building and contributing

The Serenity documentation is written in Asciidoc.
The build uses Gradle and Asciidoctor.
You can generate the documentation by running the `asciidoctor` task:

 $ gradle clean asciidoctor

The documentation is generated in [path]_build/asciidoc_.

The master document is [path]_index.asc_.
All of the chapters are included into this document.

All of the source code in the documentation is included as snippets from the sample projects in the [path]_src/sample_ directory.
Look in [path]_src/ascidoc/first-steps.asc_ to see an example of how this is done.
